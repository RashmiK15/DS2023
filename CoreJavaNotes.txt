The fundamental unit of java programming is to write a class

Greeting.java
----------------
	class Greeting
	{
		()
		{
			code here
		}
	}	

POPS = procedure oriented programming system

	pops = procedure <-- data

GLOBAL DATA
		acno	acholder	acbal
		
		homeAddress

		officeAddress

			phoneno    birthdate

			actype		



	setIntialValues() { }

		withdraw() { }

		changePhone() { }

		changeHomeAddress(){}   changeOfficeAddress() { }




OOPS = object oriented programming system

	oops = data <-- procedures

	write a class to bind the data with	
	concerned functions
	
	
	object = physical state + behaviour		

	cat    =  color, breed, weight + walk() { }
					snooze() { }
					meow() { }
					chaseMice() { }
					drinkMilk() { }

	bankaccount = acno, acholder	withdraw() { }
		     actype, acbal	deposit() { }
		     phone, email	transfer() { }
		     pin		getBalance() { }
					printMiniStatement() { }
					askForChequeBook() { }
					changePin() { }

	

1. one .java file can have as many classes as you want
2. each class may have its own main method
3. after compiling a .java file JVM will produce class
   files, that depends upon the number of classes declared in it
		
	A.java
	--------
	class X{}
	class Y{}
	class Z{}

	javac A.java
		|
		X.class  Y.class Z.class

4. how to run/which class to run?
	you can run that class which has the main method
